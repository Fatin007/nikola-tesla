        <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, which was
          then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He displayed an early
          aptitude for mathematics and science, and his passion for invention
          led him to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of
          Graz and the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.

        <h3>The AC Power Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla's most renowned contribution to the world was the development of
          alternating current (AC) electrical systems. His invention of the AC
          motor and transformer paved the way for the efficient transmission of
          electrical power over long distances, forever changing the world's
          energy infrastructure.

        <h3>Quotes from Nikola Tesla</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is
            mine."
          </li>
          <li>
            2. "Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and
            matter. When they separate, man is no more."
          </li>
          <li>
            3. "The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will
            make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries
            of its existence."
          </li>
